1. lsh.py implements Locality-sensitive hashing. The
main method also enables testing the algorithm by generating random
coordinates and computing the locality sensitive hashes and printing
out the pairs which are close to each other (based on the hash value).

2. stack.py implements a simple and efficient stack algorithm for
integers.

3. union_find.py implements union-find with weighing and path compression.

4. toposort.py implements topological sorting (Kahn 1962 algorithm).

5. maxpath.py computes the path length in a graph based on edges connecting the nodes by traversal.

6. file2ddl.py implments CSV file to DDL/loading utility.

7. dwhdiff.py implements DB table/column metadata comparison utility.
