1. lsh.py implements Locality-sensitive hashing. The
main method also enables testing the algorithm by generating random
coordinates and computing the locality sensitive hashes and printing
out the pairs which are close to each other (based on the hash value).

2. stack.py implements a simple and efficient stack algorithm for
integers.

3. union_find.py implements union-find with weighing and path compression.
